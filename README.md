# WonderKing-Emulator
I am using Java 10 but any version above 8 should work.  
This is just for experience and trying out different coding techniques. Not really sticking to any theme of naming conventions or structures.
 Hoping to make this project super simple and "plug and play" where anybody can download and start a server.
